//the digit is stored in the reverse order and thus it is very easy
//because if we add two numbers we add from the last bit rather than forwardly
//**follow up: what if they were stored in the forward order? 
//we need to reverse the linkedlist at first??

//***follow up: what if these two linkedlist are not the same long 
// we need to pad the shorter list with zeros in the head to make it properly calculate
